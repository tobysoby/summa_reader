      return "However, the contribution of the President of the Province of Catalonia Karlis, in the history of the ferocious political life in Spain, he managed to unify the population in one case and that he is gifted in controversial thought .even in the Catalan newspapers, the Potsnitas announced the irony .| El Perioudico | has been destroyed because of the swing in the stance of the Boutázt, which says yes and no at the same time to the aspirations of independence .the newspaper has not been able to conclude a clear message from the speech: there is no yes or no denial but there is no reverse .the Catalonian newspaper, the Catalonian newspaper, lacks a logical thought in the statements of Putzhni, who spoke extensively on Tuesday evening in his speech in the Catalan Parliament about the result of the referendum, i.e. the mandate to implement independence - but he proposed on behalf of his government to suspend this mandate temporarily .at the same time, they avoided all care of declaring the independence of Catalonia .| it is difficult to suspend something that has not been announced. || Puteron turns into a traitor, | and the comments of the other Spanish press are more strict, announcing that Putzhni gave up in his speech about the Catalan Independence Project, as it was reported in the | Elabas | newspaper that | his application for suspending the execution makes it to the large proportion of the separatists as a traitor. |the | Elmundo | newspaper concludes, therefore, that the game continues: | Pottingham is provoking the state. |and the leftist leftist alliance supported for independence is a leap of pride. |in the coming days and weeks, the President of the Catalonian government may find himself as being chased by all parties .he, on the one hand, did not take into account, apparently, the reaction of the European Union and the Spanish and international economy, in addition to the resistance of broad circles in Catalonia, and on the other hand, it has lost support among supporters of independence .three alternatives, political suicide, and all possibilities remain .however, El Perioudico newspaper sees three possible alternatives: new elections may be organized in Catalonia in which separatists will join the separatists and direct an attempt to break further, a constitutional reform should be organized or a regular referendum, as happened in Scotland or Quebec .there is also a fourth alternative, according to the newspaper in | political suicide. |this is how the political future emerges at least from the angle of Catalonian .this future appears to be more clear at least for the coming days from the corner of the Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Raki who urged the Spanish government to stop | the confusion. |he also asked the Catalonian government in Barcelona to give an explanation about whether the region's independence was declared or not, announcing that such a clarification must take place within five days' time .in this way, the Prime Minister has started a procedure for withdrawing the rights of the Catalan self-rule according to chapter 155 of the constitution .on this basis, it can deactivate the regional government from the power of power and abolish the self-rule of Catalonia or the declaration of a state of emergency .| it is time for constitutional reform, | and it is not certain that things will reach this point .the leader of the socialist opposition Pedro Sánchez joined the side of Raki and declared at the same time a solution from his point of view: | it is time to embark upon a constitutional amendment. |this will not include the secession of Catalonia, but it will mean a new distribution of power .the Deputy Head of the Catalonian Government, Oreol Gonqueras, promotes a strict approach to Madrid .if Madrid does not accept the presentation of the dialogue, then it should be held responsible for the result of the referendum on the independence organized on the first of October for the final declaration of independence .it rejects the holding of early elections .but Junceras is facing a problem that the referendum cannot demand political legitimacy .the percentage of those who voted only reached 40% of the population - almost all of them are among those who are pro-independence supporters .the army's preparations, but the upcoming days and weeks talks could lead to a compromise within the framework of the constitution .maybe to a small constitutional reform .and what remains possible is currently being expressed by the army .by order of the government, he is preparing for a potential intervention in Catalonia .intervention is confined to protecting the country's infrastructure .what does this mean by the fact that the central government in Madrid does not rule out what seems to be the use of political violence in the near future ?| if the situation escalates to an escalation of violence beyond the government security forces, the army must confirm its superiority. | a commander of the Spanish army announced that he maintained his identity in front of Elbair newspaper .other senior soldiers say that they would only move according to the orders of the government in Madrid .it is clear that national consensus is still at stake .Kirsten Kents / M.A.M.";
